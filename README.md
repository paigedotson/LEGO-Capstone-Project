# lego_capstone
This is a repository of my Capstone Project for Springboard. I explored the relationships between the theme of a LEGO set by the color(s) included in that LEGO set. I hypothesized that there exists unique colors within each theme created from 1950 to 2017 (data set timeline) that could identify the theme of a given set. 

The analysis was descriptive, and I identified colors that showed up infrequently in sets as 'rare colors' and determined which themes those colors uniquely showed up in. Based on the descriptive analysis, there were few sets that could be identified by presences of a unique 'rare color'. 

Further analysis will explore if there is a statistical relationship between color and theme. It will also explore whether or not the number of sets that have unique colors are statistically significant. That is, is the null hypothesis supported or rejected. 

Additional questions I would like to explore:
1. Are there color combinations that can identify a theme? (
2. What sets are you able to build if you own a Star Wars LEGO set? - I have many :)
3. Do specific color groups always show up in a theme (e.g., do reds show up more in Harry Potter sets than other sets)?

Please let me know if you have any thoughts on how I can improve my current code or any suggestions on other avenues to explore. Happy building! üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
